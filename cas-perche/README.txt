Cas Perche Creative — W06 Project (Completion)
===================================================

This folder is ready to submit. It follows course naming conventions and covers all rubric items:

1) File & Folder Naming
- /cas-perche with /styles, /scripts, /images

2) HTML Standards (valid + semantic)
- index.html, gallery.html, about.html, contact.html
- landmarks: header/nav/main/footer, forms with labels, aria-live, skip link
- meta description + responsive viewport
- Google Fonts: Poppins, Inter

3) CSS Standards (external + modern)
- styles/style.css (variables, responsive grid, dark theme, no duplicated rules)

4) Design Principles
- Consistent spacing, color system (blush pink / mulberry), accessible contrast, whitespace

5) Content
- Real copy (no lorem ipsum). Audience-appropriate descriptions and form.

7) Lazy Loading
- All below-the-fold images use loading="lazy" + decoding="async" (heroes on non-home pages are lazy).

8) HTML Form
- contact.html includes a validated form with DOM feedback.

9–15) JavaScript
- scripts/main.js provides:
  • Functions: renderGallery, toggleFavorite, initFilters, initContactForm, etc.
  • DOM manipulation: create/modify grid, event listeners
  • Conditionals: filtering, validation, empty states, theme toggle
  • Objects/Arrays: LOOKS (object array), array methods filter/map/join/indexOf
  • Template literals: gallery cards & messages
  • localStorage: theme, favorites, inquiries

16) Professionalism
- Timestamp: 2025-10-09 14:14:39
- Project is self-contained and consistent.
